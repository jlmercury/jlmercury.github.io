I"•<p>Today i finished the Learn Enough JavaScript course on Learn Enough tutorial site.
It was a bit ( I mean, way more) difficult than other tutorials like HTML, or git tutorial I had previously done.</p>

<p>But I feel confident, because now I have a certain skill to write a <em>script language</em>, it is a door to the more profound world of developing.</p>

<p>It is only a foundation, though, so I have to learn a way more things than the tutorial. I have to get some essential skill to code neatly, so that everyone could read it.</p>

<p>One book I would be getting is <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/JavaScript-Parts-%E2%80%95%E3%80%8C%E8%89%AF%E3%81%84%E3%83%91%E3%83%BC%E3%83%84%E3%80%8D%E3%81%AB%E3%82%88%E3%82%8B%E3%83%99%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%83%97%E3%83%A9%E3%82%AF%E3%83%86%E3%82%A3%E3%82%B9-Douglas-Crockford/dp/4873113911/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_ja_JP=%E3%82%AB%E3%82%BF%E3%82%AB%E3%83%8A&amp;keywords=good+parts+javascript&amp;qid=1570415753&amp;sr=8-1">This</a>.</p>

<p>Although it is said to be a bit old-dated, I think it must be a good one.</p>

<p>So I want to learn more about JavaScript so that I would get more skills to code clean and beautifylly.</p>
